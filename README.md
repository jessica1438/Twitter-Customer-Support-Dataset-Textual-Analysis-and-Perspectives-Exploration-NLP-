# Twitter-Customer-Support-Dataset-Textual-Analysis-and-Perspectives-Exploration-NLP-using-Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, TF-IDF Model, and Count Vectorizer on Twitter Customer Support Dataset


Steps in the Analysis:

1) Top 15 Most Frequent Words (Count Vectorizer): Utilizing a count vectorizer along with text preprocessing techniques to identify the 15 most frequently occurring words in the text column.

2) Top 50 Most Frequent Words (TF-IDF Model): Constructing a TF-IDF model to determine the top 50 most frequent words and comparing these results with the count vectorizer.

3) Word Embedding Models: Training and creating Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText word embedding models on the provided Twitter dataset.

4) Comparison of Similar Words: Comparing words similar to the top 15 most frequent words identified in step 1 using the word embedding models (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText).

Analysis from Three Perspectives:

a) Context Analysis: Examining the context in which words appear in the Twitter data to decipher any underlying themes or patterns.

b) Product Insights: Identifying any product or service-specific information present in the dataset to gain insights into customer experiences and preferences.

c) Location References: Determining whether there are geographic-specific details or references within the Twitter data, if any.
